## About the Project
This project aims to develop an **autonomous robot** (“GolfBot”) that can collect and deliver golf balls (simulated by table tennis balls) within a predefined arena, following specific scoring rules and constraints. The end goal is to demonstrate a **fully autonomous** solution capable of navigating obstacles and maximizing the points earned.

### Key Features
- **Autonomous movement** using LEGO EV3 motors and sensors.  
- **Collection mechanism** for picking up balls on the field.  
- **Delivery mechanism** to deposit balls in designated goals for points.  
- **Time-based scoring** with penalties for touching arena walls or moving obstacles.
